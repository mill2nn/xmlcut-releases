"""
Raw-cutter - extract every cut of a Premiere Pro timeline as an individual video file.

Reads a Final Cut Pro 7 XML export (Premiere: File > Export > Final Cut Pro XML),
resolves each clipitem back to its source media, and uses ffmpeg to cut the exact
frame range the editor used. Emits a CSV + JSON manifest describing every clip.

Every cut is re-encoded, deliberately: it is the only path that is frame exact. There is
no flag to turn stream copy back on.

Usage:
    python3 xmlcut.py timeline.xml -o ./clips
    python3 xmlcut.py timeline.xml -o ./clips --dry-run
    python3 xmlcut.py timeline.xml -o ./clips --remap "/Volumes/OldDrive=/Volumes/NewDrive"
    python3 xmlcut.py timeline.xml --manifest-only

Requires: ffmpeg + ffprobe on PATH. No third-party Python packages.

# imports every clip a frame long. Neither `-shortest` nor trimming the audio fixes the
# mp4 header; only leaving audio out does. Measured: 48 frames of 24 fps video declared
# 2.041 s with audio, 2.000 s without.

#     4 jobs 7.2s · 7 jobs 7.7s · 14 jobs 8.3s · 14 jobs w/ 2 threads 7.9s
# i.e. more jobs is SLOWER, and the whole spread is 19%. Four would win on local

# These used to be pinned constants with a note saying they were "decided once rather

# DEFAULTS are the measured ones, and moving off them has consequences the tool states
# rather than leaves to be discovered:
#
#   crf        1 is the default because crf 0 emits High 4:4:4 Predictive, which will
#              not play on a Mac. Raising crf costs quality and saves a lot of space.
#              Fractional values are real, not rounded away — see crf_of().
#   bitrate    an alternative to crf, not an addition. Target-rate mode makes file size
#              predictable, which is the reason to want it.
#   fps        ⚠️ CHANGING THIS BREAKS FRAME EXACTNESS. Resampling to another rate
#              drops or duplicates frames, so the file no longer holds the frames the
#              timeline used. Recorded per clip as frame_exact=false, and said out loud.
#              Asked PER CUT — forcing the rate the media already has is a no-op and is
#              not emitted at all, because emitting it corrupts the head.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CALIBRATED by encoding real clips at six crf values and measuring what came out. That
# calibration ran ONCE, offline; nothing here encodes anything. The measurements are in
# CLAUDE.md; these are the tables they produced.
#
# The unit is OUTPUT BITS PER PIXEL PER FRAME, which is the thing that clusters. Two facts
# came out of the calibration and both are load-bearing:
#
#   1. CODEC CLASS separates it. Intraframe sources in this workflow are camera or studio
#      originals and encode to roughly a third of the bits an already-compressed source of
#      the same size does, because a re-encode has to reproduce the first encoder's
#      artefacts as well as the picture. Output bpp at crf 14: h264 0.15-0.30, ProRes
#      0.068-0.087.
#
#   2. A SOURCE'S OWN BITRATE IS A CEILING, NOT A PREDICTOR. Scaling it — which is what
#      this used to do — is right in kind only for inter-frame footage at ordinary rates,
#      and was 186x wrong on a 632 Mbps ProRes. It is kept only as an upper bound for the
#      inter-frame path, where a genuinely low-bitrate source really does encode small.
#
# Accuracy, against the 40 real measurements it was fitted to: median 1.00x, 37/40 within
# 1.5x, 38/40 within 2x, worst 5.7x on a 4K clip at crf 28 where output collapses faster
# than any table follows. It is an ESTIMATE and the wording everywhere says so.

    ⚠️ ONLY .py FILES WERE EVER CHECKED. apply_update compiled the Python and stored
    everything else exactly as it arrived, so a half main.js went to disk and into Adobe's
    extension folder with `ok: true`. Staged with _fetch handing back the first 200000 of
    434713 bytes: the update reported `updated 3.70 → 3.71 … panel updated`, the installed
    main.js was 200000 bytes, `node --check` on it failed with `SyntaxError: missing )
    after argument list` at line 3636, and — because the engine had been written at the
    same time and now reported the new number — the next check answered "up to date"
    forever. Only re-running the installer repairs that, and nothing says so.

    So every file is checked, and the whole update is refused rather than one bad file
    written. The checks are structural and deliberately dull, because a validator that
    rejects a GOOD release breaks seven machines at once, which is worse than what it is
    guarding against:

      * a floor no released file can be under (MIN_RELEASE_BYTES)
      * XML has to parse — the manifest CEP reads, and the .debug port file
      * HTML has to carry its closing tag
      * JS / JSX / CSS have to end on `;` or `}` once trailing comments are taken off.
        Measured on all five shipped files: every one of them does, and the 200000-byte
        truncation above ends mid-identifier on `s`. Shell launchers are exempt — they
        legitimately end on `fi` or `echo`.

    The comment stripping is not a nicety: the first cut of this check refused a main.js
    with `/* 3.71 marker */` appended, which is a perfectly whole file. A validator that
    can refuse a good release is worse than the truncation it is guarding against, so
    anything ambiguous is allowed through and left to the length check.

    tests/check_delivery.py runs this over every file in UPDATE_FILES as it stands in the

    ⚠️ THIS IS THE MIX, AND NOTHING READ IT UNTIL NOW. `<effectid>audiolevels</effectid>`
    with `<parameterid>level</parameterid>` is where every fader move on a clip and every
    track fader ends up in the XML, and _timeline_audio.mp3 summed every part at unity
    through amix(normalize=0) regardless. MEASURED on 61 real exports (46 of them distinct):
    436 clipitem levels and 163 track levels are NOT 1.0, spread over 53 files — so on this
    corpus the un-levelled mix is the normal case, not the corner case. On a controlled
    fixture whose two tones are normalised to an identical peak (voice mono at 1.0, bed
    stereo at 0.25) the delivered mp3 put the bed 3.10 dB ABOVE the voice where Premiere has
    it 12.04 dB below: 15.14 dB of inverted balance.

    Values run either side of unity — the measured corpus holds 0.1408 (-17.0 dB) through
    3.5398 (+11.0 dB) — so this both attenuates and boosts, and a make-up stage has to
    expect both.

    A KEYFRAMED fader is reduced to its FIRST key and reported, exactly as read_timeremap
    does with a speed ramp: following the curve means writing a volume expression per part
    and getting it subtly wrong is worse than a documented approximation. 6 of the corpus's
    599 level parameters are keyframed. Note the `<value>` beside the keyframes is NOT the
    first key (measured: value 1 with keys 0.561226 then 1), so the keys win when present.

    ⚠️ AND PREMIERE'S CLIP "AUDIO GAIN" IS A SECOND FILTER, multiplied in. Audio Gain (the
    G key) is not a fader move: the export writes it as its own effect, `<name>Gain</name>`,
    effectid `{61756678, 4761696e, 4b657947}`, parameter `Gain(dB)` in DECIBELS — and this
    function used to skip it, so every gained clip reached the mix at its un-gained level
    while the manifest said levels_applied. MEASURED on a fixture: a -12 dB Gain on A2 put
    it 0.0 dB against A1 in the mix instead of -12; on a real export four of these sit on one
    SFX (+4 dB), and its stretch of _track_A3.mp3 read -30.1 dB before and -26.1 after.
    Premiere applies the two in series, so the linear product is what reaches the track —
    Gain +4 with Levels 0.5 is -2.02 dB. A keyframed Gain is reduced to its first key and
    flagged, exactly like the fader.

    ⚠️ AUDIO TRANSITIONS USED TO REACH ONLY THE CLIP EDGES, never the level. The mix placed

    end-black fade played at full level to the last frame and stopped dead — MEASURED on a
    fixture, -15.6 dB mean in the last 0.26 s of a 2 s fade-out against a -15.3 body, and on
    a real export's music track the same: -23.7 dB half way through its 1 s end fade, louder
    than the body before it (-25.3). With the fades it reads -30.9 there.

    Premiere writes the transition as its own item on the track, and FCP7 marks the edge it
    defines with -1, which resolve_transition_edges has already filled in — so by here:

    whose end is this clip's end fades it out, within a frame. A transition that matches no
    clip edge (the edges were written explicitly, not as -1) is left unmarked, and the mix

    it. A retimed or reversed clip is left out of the mix altogether, so it gets none — but

    "(00.00-00.02)" into "(00/00-00/02)". A dot also keeps the hyphen free to mean one
    thing only — the gap between the two ends of the range.

    ⚠️ CLAMPED AT 00.00, AND THE CLAMP IS THE POINT. A clipitem whose in-point sits before
    its media begins has a NEGATIVE source in-point, and the old arithmetic put the sign on
    the hundredths instead of in front of the number:

        -0.40 -> "00.-40"      -0.01 -> "00.-1"      -1.50 -> "-1.-50"

    14_(00.-40-01.87)_131.mp4 has three plausible readings of where the clip starts.

            <clipitem id="clipitem-42">  <name>a nest clipitem</name>

        nest's frames 0-1366 and the reference plays 1366-1586 — 220 frames of different
        content, which resolved to nothing at all before this existed.

        UNLIKE _register_file this records only DEFINITIONS. A file entry is a dict that a
        reference still needs to exist so the lookup does not fail; a sequence reference is
        resolved BY the index, so storing body-less elements would let a reference
        overwrite the definition it is trying to find. Registering in one pass ahead of the

        — true of the pixels, and irrelevant to the mix, which is built from SOURCE files
        whatever the mode. The nest's audio clipitem became one cut with no file, media_kind

        audio_tracks_available so the panel offered no tick for it, and the same XML in
        source mode mixed it at the right offset. The panel never sends --nest, so this was
        every Timeline Render export with a nested voice-over.

        files written for a twenty-two-clip master track: 31 - 9 = 22, and the nine extras
        were redundant copies.

        WHERE THEY COME FROM. A nested sequence's inner clipitems are all stamped with the
        PARENT clipitem's track index — they are placed on the parent's timeline, so that is
        right — but a nest with STACKED inner video tracks can hold the same shot on inner V1
        and inner V2 across the same span. Flattened onto one parent track those become two
        cuts identical in every field that decides an output.

        WHY DE-DUPLICATION RATHER THAN RENUMBERING. pick_key is (track type, track index,
        timeline in, timeline out); it is also render_name, and the panel's clipKey. Giving
        inner clips a synthetic track index would make those keys unique but would put nested
        cuts on a track number the timeline does not have, and --video-track (which render
        mode uses to keep only the master track) would then drop every nested cut. Refusing to
        resolve such a nest loses the clips. Dropping a duplicate loses NOTHING: the second
        cut would have produced the same bytes under a different index.

        ⚠️ AND IT IS ALSO THE PANEL SYMPTOM: "two videos in the same nested sequence are
        linked to each other" — untick one and the other unticks too. The panel's row identity
        is those same four fields, so two colliding cuts were always one row to it. There is
        one row now because there is one cut.

        ⚠️ THE IDENTITY IS THE USER'S OWN, AND THE TIMELINE POSITION IS THE PART THAT MUST
        NOT BE DROPPED: "detect if the clip name and the in out, duration is the same mark
        them as one" — plus the timeline position, which he confirmed after being shown the
        case that breaks without it. Two files in one of his own output folders share a
        name, a source range and a byte size and are BOTH legitimate: the same source clip
        placed twice at two different points on the timeline, which is two real shots.
        Merging on name and source range alone deletes one of every such pair.

        So: clip name + source in/out + duration + TIMELINE in/out. Track is in there too,
        because the same clip on two tracks at one instant is two different pictures; speed
        and reverse are in there because they change the pixels. The key is therefore wider
        than pick_key in every direction — anything that could alter a single output byte,
        or even the label on it, keeps both cuts.

        So: absent or 0 starts a new track, non-zero continues the current one. Decided from
        the ATTRIBUTES ALONE, before any clipitem is looked at, so an empty lane is numbered
        like a populated one and consumes its group number without resetting anything — an
        empty pair sitting between A1 and the music shifts every track above it, and a
        content-derived rule cannot even see it.

        ⚠️ totalExplodedTrackCount IS NOT THE DRIVER, and must not become one: lane 1 above
        is a `total=1` stereo track, because its clips are mono. Lane count follows the
        CLIPS' channel width, not the track's. It is used here only as a consistency check.

        ⚠️ THE sourcetrack/trackindex RULE IS REFUTED — do not re-derive it. It collapses
        both tests/PROMO_MASTER_v7.xml and the fixture check_audio_tracks.py generates into
        a single audio track, it cannot number an empty lane at all, and a mono clip on a
        stereo track writes ONE lane while an empty stereo track writes TWO.

        Backward compatible by construction: the attribute is absent on every existing
        fixture in this repo and on every <video> lane, and absent means "start a new
        track", so the result is 1..n — byte-identical to the enumerate() this replaces.

        transitionitem's start and a -1 end is the following transitionitem's end:

        inner cut is kept only if it is visible through that window, trimmed to it, and
        re-expressed in parent time.

        ASSUMPTION, stated because it is the one that could be wrong: a nest's
        <in>/<out> are read in the CLIPITEM's rate, exactly as a file clipitem's are —
        Premiere conforms both to the parent sequence rate. Inner clipitems' own
        <start>/<end> are read in the NESTED sequence's rate. That is self-consistent
        and verified against the fixture.

        MEASURED against a real Premiere export as of 2026-08-20 (a client timeline
        using one nest twice): the reference spelling is confirmed — see
        _register_sequence — and both instances live inside a clipitem, so neither shows
        up in the --sequence picker. What is still NOT measured is the RATE assumption in
        the paragraph above: that export's nest runs at the parent's 30 fps, so a nest
        with a different timebase would not have exercised it.

        EVERY inner video track contributes, flattened onto the parent clipitem's track
        index. This function is only reached at all when nest_mode is "all"; render mode's
        default collapses a nest to one cut in _parse without coming here. An inner-V1-only

    """A Timeline built from the Raw-cutter panel's JSON instead of an XML.

    Deliberately duck-types `Timeline`: same attribute names, same `Cut` objects, so
    every downstream stage — naming, probing, building the ffmpeg command, the
    manifest — runs unchanged and stays covered by the same reasoning.

    What the panel gives that an XML cannot:

      * the INTERPRETED frame rate, which is what Premiere actually cut against
      * keyframed speed ramps, reported per clip rather than flattened to one number
      * real media paths — Premiere's LAST KNOWN ones, which is not the same as present

    What it cannot give: the contents of a nested sequence. Premiere hands the nest
    over as a single clip, and resolving it would mean re-deriving the nest walking
    that the XML path already does. Nests are reported and skipped, never guessed at.

    the media. The audio is in the file; only the bytes are incomplete. (2) With a shim that
    fails -show_streams, a control run of `23 written` becomes `19 written … 4 silent
    source` — four real audio clips lost, nothing anywhere naming ffprobe. The manifest's
    media columns collapse in the same silence: same clip, control vs shim, codec 'h264'->'',
    width 640->None, pix_fmt 'yuv420p'->'', bitrate 1096193->None.

    The timeout is the caller's, not a hard-coded 60 s: the whole point of --timeout is media
    that is slow to reach, and a fixed limit here made that flag a half-measure. The `except`
    deliberately catches TimeoutExpired and OSError alike — a stall and a fault are both
    "could not read it", and both must be reported rather than shrugged off.

    A picture cut is measured against the first video stream that is not cover art. A
    stream that carries no duration of its own (Matroska keeps it in a tag) falls back to
    the container's, which is what every cut was measured against before; so does a figure
    larger than the container's, which the container would be wrong about.

    ⚠️ THE STREAM'S DURATION IS A LENGTH, NOT AN END. The picture ends at the video stream's
    start_time plus its duration, and the cut's seconds are counted from the CONTAINER's
    start_time — ffmpeg's input -ss adds format.start_time to the seek, and build_command
    seeks with nothing else (MEASURED, 23 Sep: with the container starting at 0.4787 and
    the picture at 0.5000, a cut at frame 100 delivered picture 99, which is where 3.3333 s
    after the CONTAINER's start falls). So the end on that clock is
    v.start_time + v.duration - format.start_time. Read as the bare duration, every file
    whose picture starts after its container came out a frame short: 20 of 294 real files
    on this machine start their picture 0.96-1.00 frame in (downloaded web video, all with
    the container at 0), a cut to the last frame of any of them was booked
    overhang_trimmed and lost that frame. Measured against the last packet's end on all 294:
    this form lands within 0.05 frame on 281, the bare duration on 261, and it is never the
    worse of the two. A stream with no start_time is taken to start with the container.

    ⚠️ AN AUDIO CUT KEEPS THE CONTAINER'S LENGTH, deliberately: the finding and every
    measurement behind this are about PICTURE, where -frames:v makes a missing frame fatal.
    Audio has no pin, an AAC stream's own duration carries its priming, and its out_time

# measured by pixel against a full decode; an older build behaved differently. Editors run
# whatever `brew install ffmpeg` gave them, so no constant can be right on every Mac.
#
# And the one point every rule agrees on — T exactly equal to the frame's timestamp — is
# only that frame's timestamp on a file whose frames sit EXACTLY on the k/fps grid. iPhone
# footage does not: 59.94 fps in a 1/600 timebase is 10- and 11-tick frames, running up to
# 0.16 of a frame early and 0.12 late of the grid (surveyed across eight of the team's
# 224 MOVs). Aiming exactly at k/fps on ffmpeg 9 therefore skipped every early frame:
# MEASURED, 22 of 160 seeks returned frame k+1, all on iPhone files, 19-56% per file, and
# on the team's own R11 edit 4 of 9 delivered clips started a frame late and ended a frame
# past the out-point, every one marked ok and frame_exact.
#
# So the aim is MEASURED, once per ffmpeg build, on a clip whose frames carry their own
# index as brightness: seek to eight sub-frame offsets around a known frame, keep the
# offsets that return it, and aim at the middle of that range. On ffmpeg 9 that is half a
# frame early; on a build that returns the frame displaying at T it would be half a frame
# late; either way the aim has the widest margin available against grid drift. Checked on
# the same 160 seeks: 0 wrong. The result is cached per `ffmpeg -version` line in the temp
# folder, and ANY failure to measure falls back to 0 — today's behaviour — uncached, so the
# next run tries again rather than living with a guess.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── which source frame fills each output slot
#
# ⚠️ EVERY RESAMPLE IN build_command GOES THROUGH HERE — EXCEPT A CUT OF MEDIA WHOSE HEADER
# SAYS IT IS VARIABLE-RATE, forward or reversed, which keeps 3.88's filters, see
# keeps_base_resample() below — AND IT MAPS BY FRAME INDEX, NOT BY TIME. The four resample sites used to end in `fps=X:round=up` on the frames' own
# timestamps, which puts in output slot j the source frame displaying at j/X. That is right
# whenever the pin and the two rates agree — it is what the 6 Sep fix bought (output 0 is the
# in-point on a 300% retime, not a later frame) — and exactly wrong when the output rate sits
# a hair ABOVE the input: the two rates the panel offers, 30 and 60, on 29.97/59.94 footage.
# Input frame 1 then starts 1/1000 of a frame after slot 1 does, so slot 1 still shows frame
# 0, every frame after it lands one slot late, and the -frames:v pin cuts the shot's last
# frame off. MEASURED by frame ID on the real engine, 23 Sep: --fps 30 on 29.97 came back
# [100, 100, 101 … 138] for 100..139 on 4 of 4 clips, --fps 60 on 59.94 the same on 3 of 3,
# and --fps 30 on 59.94 opened [200, 201, 203 …] and stayed one source frame out of step to
# the end (… 595, 597 where 596, 598 is every other frame from the in-point). On the team's
# own iPhone edit at --fps 60, 8 of 8 clips lost their last frame, all reported OK.
# round=near is no answer — it throws the in-point away above two source frames per output
# frame, which is the bug round=up was brought in to fix.
#
# So the mapping is stated outright, on the two numbers each caller has already worked out:
# the cut's n source frames and the m output slots its -frames:v pins.
#
#   m <= n (the same count, or fewer slots than frames): slot j shows frame floor(j*n/m).
#       This IS what round=up delivered whenever the rates agree with the pin — 60->30 is
#       every other frame from the in-point, 300% is 0, 3, 6 … — and with m == n (every
#       29.97->30 clip under 500 frames) it is the identity: no duplicate at all.
#   m > n (more slots than frames, so some frame has to repeat): frame i takes over at slot
#       round(i*m/n), halves up. An integer slow-down still holds every frame for the same
#       number of slots (25% is four each, exactly as before), but a clip one frame SHORT of
#       its slots — 29.97->30 over 500 frames, 59.94->60 over 8.3 s — repeats a frame in the
#       MIDDLE, where time-based rounding put the repeat on slot 1: the cut itself.
#
#   `centred=False` keeps the first rule for m > n as well. The --speed timeline retime at
#   the sequence's own rate passes it: there floor(j*n/m) is Premiere's own frame sampling
#   (a 24 fps clip in a 30 fps timeline shows 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 …), and matching what the
#   timeline showed is that mode's whole promise.
#
# Either way output 0 is the in-point, no slot shows a frame outside [0, n), and the last
# slot shows the range's own tail when m >= n. A frame past n (the generous -t reads one
# more) is parked past the pin, where it can never be shown.
#
# How: setpts stamps frame N at the slot where it takes over, plus a fraction of 1/(4n) of a
# slot that keeps it strictly inside the slot it belongs to, and fps=round=down then holds
# each frame until the next one takes over. It is stamped in a NANOSECOND timebase because a
# camera timebase (1/600 on iPhone) cannot hold 1/(4n) of a slot; the margin stays wider
# than the nanosecond truncation up to ~4 million frames at 60 fps. The fps filter is handed
# the SAME rational the stamps were computed on, so its conversion into slots is exact
# integer arithmetic. setpts also stamps the END of the stream by the same expression at
# N = frames seen, so a range that ends on the file's last frame still fills its last slot.

    frame_map_filters() counts frames that are not there: n is the range's length times the
    NOMINAL rate, a phone that drops frames holds fewer, and the index map walks through the
    out-point (measured: 5-10 frames past a 2-4 s cut at --fps 30, all `ok`). Three rounds of
    replacements for it — time sampling anchored on the in-point, a one-second seek lead, a
    forward-then-reversed sampling grid — each traded one defect for another, and each was
    checked only on a 1/600 fixture, where a seek always lands on a tick. MEASURED on frame-ID
    VFR media at 29.97/59.94 on 1/30000, 1/60000 and 1/90000 clocks, 23 Sep: 4-6 of 20
    forward clips per mode opened on the frame BEFORE the in-point (seek_bias lands the
    printed -ss on a half tick, ffmpeg rounds it to the stream's time base by up to half a
    tick, and the anchor's 1e-4-frame epsilon is smaller than that), and 7-12 of 20 reversed
    clips opened with a frame from past the out-point — every one reported ok, where 3.88 had
    delivered the forward ones slot-exact. So a variable-rate cut is cut exactly as 3.88 cut
    it, in every mode: `setpts=PTS/k` for a retime, `select` + `reverse` for a reverse, and
    `fps=X:round=up` on the frames' own timestamps, with 3.88's six-decimal rate and its
    container-length overhang (see apply_probe). Its own imperfections on such files are
    pre-existing and not traded for new ones here — MEASURED on the 120 variable-rate clips
    in tests/check_delivery.py: 62 refused as "wrote 26 frame(s) where 30 were asked" (the pin
    counts nominal frames the range does not hold), and all 16 delivered reversed clips open
    on a frame from past the out-point. That suite pins every command to 3.88's formula and
    grades the pixels on 1/30000, 1/60000, 1/90000 and 1/600 variable-rate fixtures.

    With no frame count at all (no source rate) there is nothing to map by index either,
    and 3.88's time-rounded chain is all there is. Constant-rate media with a count keeps the
    index map, where it is exact.

    With lane grouping in the XML (lane_count > 0) it is simply the Premiere track: the lanes
    of a stereo pair share one, and a copy on another track is another clip.

    Without it, every <track> is its own premiere_track, and an FCP7-style export writes a
    stereo pair as two of them. Keying on the track there would sum the pair to +6.02 dB, the
    defect the collapse exists to prevent. So a lane-less item's identity is its FADER: parts
    of one file, range and position collapse unless their levels differ.

    ⚠️ NOT "HOW MANY TIMES THIS SOURCETRACK HAS BEEN SEEN". That was the first attempt, on the
    theory that a pair is sourcetrack 1 + 2 and a copy is 1 + 1. A pair is NOT always 1 + 2:
    both lanes can carry trackindex 1, or no <sourcetrack> at all, and then the second lane
    counted as a deliberate copy and was summed — MEASURED with a 300 Hz left / 3 kHz right
    source, _timeline_audio.mp3 per channel went from -15.3 / -15.2 dB to -9.2 / -9.2 dB,
    +6 dB hot. The trackindex says nothing about pair-versus-copy on its own.

    ⚠️ WHAT THIS COSTS: a lane-less copy at the SAME level as the original is indistinguishable
    from the second lane of a stereo pair — same file, range, position and gain, nothing else
    in the XML to tell them apart — and it collapses, as it always did. vo_contributions says
    so in its note rather than blaming stereo lanes outright. A copy at a DIFFERENT level
    (the thickening trick F29 was measured on: 1.0 + 0.5) keeps both layers, because the two
    lanes of one stereo clip carry one level. None of the three real exports on hand has a

    function that used it was wrong by up to 200x on real footage. Measured on a 19-clip
    production timeline at crf 15.5, output rate as a multiple of the source's:

        h264   1080x1920, src 10-20 Mbps    0.55-1.09x    model said 1.16x   ~1.6x high
        h264   3840x2160, src 260 Mbps      0.30x         model said 1.16x   ~4x high
        prores 2000x2000, src 632-728 Mbps  0.006-0.008x  model said 1.16x   ~180x high

    An intraframe codec spends hundreds of megabits on a shot that x264 encodes in four,
    so its bitrate says nothing whatever about what H.264 will cost. Nor does resolution:
    bits per pixel at one crf ranged 0.065 to 0.308 across those same clips, a 5x spread,
    because that number IS content complexity and cannot be inferred from a container.

    So this measures. One second of the real clip, through the real build_command, at the
    real settings — the same encoder, filters and flags the export will use, which is why
    it is right rather than merely closer.

    ⚠️ SAMPLED IN SEVERAL PLACES, not just at the head. The first version took one second
    from the start and was out by 2.19x on a 9.4-second clip whose opening move is busier
    than the rest of it — a 10% sample of the least representative part. Up to three slices
    spread through the clip, so the estimate sees the quiet middle as well as the entrance.
    On the same 19 clips that took the worst case from 2.19x to within a fifth.

    Bounded on purpose: at most PROBE_SLICES short reads, each with a timeout. Media can
    live on a network share and a 728 Mbps ProRes read can stall; a probe that hangs
    would turn a scan into a wait with no explanation, so a timeout leaves probe_bps at 0
    and the caller falls back rather than blocking.

    ⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Premiere sometimes hands back a render one frame longer
    than the range it was asked for. The encode pins -frames:v to the cut's own length with
    no seek, so ffmpeg keeps the FIRST N frames — which is right if the extra frame is at
    the tail and wrong at every single frame if it is at the head. Measured on 12 real
    exports: 1 render-mode clip in 140, delivered `status ok`, `frame_exact true`, notes
    empty, holding timeline 972..1049 under a label that says 973..1050.

    ⚠️ AND THE RULE IS EVIDENCE, NOT ARITHMETIC. There is nothing in the numbers that says
    which end overshot; the answer is in the pixels, and the reference is the NEIGHBOURING
    RENDER. In render mode the picture carries Premiere's colour, titles, Motion and ramps,
    so the raw source cannot be a reference — but the cut before this one was exported by
    the same encoder from the same timeline, and if this render overshot at the head then
    its first frame IS the frame that render ends on.

        head  <=>  C[0] is the same picture as PREV[last]  AND  C[1] is not
        tail  <=>  C[last] is the same picture as NEXT[0]   AND  C[last-1] is not

    The second half of each test is what makes it evidence rather than a coincidence. On a
    locked-off shot every frame matches every other frame, so both halves fire, the test is
    inconclusive by construction, and the clip is refused. That is the intended outcome and
    not a gap: refusing costs a re-render of one range, while guessing ships a clip trimmed
    at the wrong end, which is indistinguishable from the bug.

    Anything less than unambiguous is "unclear": no neighbour, a neighbour that is not
    exactly adjacent (a cross-dissolve makes the ranges OVERLAP, so "the frame before" is
    not a single frame), a neighbour whose own render is not exact, or a frame that would
    not decode. Every one of those refuses the cut in run_cut rather than delivering
    something unverified.

    ⚠️ A CROSS-DISSOLVE BOUNDARY CAN NEVER BE RESOLVED, and that is a consequence rather
    than an oversight. Under the default --transitions ignore the two clips OVERLAP, so
    nothing abuts this cut and there is no neighbour to find; under --transitions split they
    abut at the midpoint, but the frames either side are both the blended program, so the
    "and the frame beside it is different" half measures how much a dissolve moves in one
    frame rather than whether the shot changed, and it does not clear the threshold. Either
    way the answer is "cannot tell", and a +1 render on a dissolve-adjacent clip is refused.
    That is the right answer — under a dissolve "the frame before" is genuinely not a single
    frame — but it means those clips need a re-render rather than a repair.

    ⚠️ ONLY +1 IS EXAMINED, AND THE LIMIT IS DELIBERATE. A render two frames long could be
    one at each end, two at the head or two at the tail, and the two-frame test above cannot
    separate those — so it would report "unclear" on every one of them, turning
    RENDER_FRAME_SLACK from a documented tolerance into a refusal without anyone deciding
    that. Those still ship with the warning they have always had. Whether they should is a
    real question and a separate one: it changes a policy that predates this mechanism, has
    its own rationale and its own tests, and the answer is not implied by the answer here.

def collapse_exploded_audio_lanes(cuts: list[Cut]) -> tuple[list[Cut], list[dict]]:
    """One clipitem on one Premiere AUDIO track becomes ONE cut, not one per channel.

    ⚠️ THE BUG, MEASURED ON A STEREO TIMELINE. Premiere writes one <track> per audio
    CHANNEL — Timeline.premiere_track_numbers documents 9 lanes for 4 tracks on the one
    real export — and cut construction emits a Cut per clipitem per lane with nothing
    collapsing them. So a two-lane track holding three clips gave SIX cuts in three
    byte-identical pairs: six rows in the panel's list, six entries in the pick file, six
    files on disk. Meanwhile args.audio_tracks_available de-duplicated its own count, so
    the panel offered "A2 · 3 items" and ticking it delivered six — the menu and the
    delivery disagreed by a factor of two and neither said so.

    Nothing downstream reads <sourcetrack>, so both halves of a pair are the same
    full-width cut of the same source range: the second file is a redundant copy of the
    first, exactly as _drop_duplicate_cuts describes for stacked nest layers.

    THE GROUPING IS PREMIERE'S OWN. premiere_track already carries the A-number derived
    from currentExplodedTrackIndex — that logic is not re-derived here, it is read. Two
    cuts on DIFFERENT Premiere tracks that merely share a source range are two different
    clips (the same music bed under two shots, one on A2 and one on A3) and keep their
    keys: premiere_track is in the identity.

    WHY track_index IS NOT IN THE IDENTITY, and this is the whole point: the lane ordinal
    is the ONLY field two exploded halves differ in. It stays on the surviving cut, which
    is the LOWEST lane of the group — the one Premiere writes first — so pick_key,
    render_name and the panel's clipKey keep reading a lane ordinal and stay unique.
    Nothing is renumbered.

    EVERY OTHER FIELD THAT COULD MOVE A BYTE OR A LABEL KEEPS BOTH CUTS, the same rule
    _drop_duplicate_cuts states: name, timeline range, source path, source range, speed,
    reverse, enabled, the nest it came out of, and the audio fader (a level that differs
    per channel is a mix this pass must not average away).

    A TIMELINE WITH NO EXPLODED LANES CANNOT BE TOUCHED BY THIS, by construction rather
    than by luck: with the attribute absent premiere_track_numbers returns 1..n, so
    premiere_track == track_index, so two cuts sharing premiere_track share their lane
    ordinal too — and _drop_duplicate_cuts has already removed any pair identical in
    every remaining field. Measured on tests/PROMO_MASTER_v7.xml: 0 merged.

def split_transition_overlaps(cuts: list[Cut], seq_fps: float) -> int:
    """Where two cuts on one track OVERLAP, move the boundary to the middle of the overlap.

    Premiere represents a cross-dissolve as the two clips overlapping by the transition's
    length, so both of them genuinely occupy those frames. In source mode that is harmless:
    each clip is cut from its own camera file and the overlap shows its own un-blended
    footage. In render mode it is not, because a render IS the timeline — on a real
    client edit, cut 18 (1051-1071) and cut 19 (1058-1152) came out holding the same
    thirteen frames, pixel for pixel, both showing the dissolve mid-blend.

    Splitting at the midpoint keeps every frame exactly once and puts the cut where the
    blend is half done, which is roughly where the eye reads it. The alternative — dropping
    the overlap from both — loses every transition frame in the dataset.

    Per TRACK, and for every video track rather than only the master: overlaps can only
    happen within a track, and doing them all means the scan and the export compute the
    same ranges without the scan needing to know which track is master. They must agree
    exactly, because the render's FILENAME is built from these numbers on one side and
    looked up by them on the other.

    Returns the number of boundaries moved. Overlaps with no transition at the boundary are

    """What the output folder ALREADY holds, and what vouches for each file.

    ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. `--resume` used to be `out_path.exists()`, and `out_path` carries the
    index that `assign_output_names` hands out with `enumerate()` — AFTER every filter. So a
    second run with a different selection renumbers everything, last run's `03_…` is this
    run's `07_…`, and the check misses. Measured on a real folder: it matched 1 of 8 clips,
    which made the panel's "skip clips already there" tick a control that quietly did almost
    nothing.

    Two sources, and only ever one of them:

    * the folder's LEDGER (seeded from its manifest when it has none yet): file -> the
      cut_id and the settings it was made under. cut_id is a content hash of the clip, so
      it survives renumbering, a re-sort and the cross-dissolve split.
    * the filename with its index prefix stripped, ONLY for a folder that holds no record
      at all — one an old version wrote and then lost its manifest from.

    ⚠️ NEVER BOTH. The filename route used to run beside the record for every cut the record
    did not name, and it asked only whether exactly one file on disk wore that index-free
    name — not whom the record had given it to. MEASURED on the suite's own fixture:
    Cutaway_fast (forward, 200%) and Reverse_shot (reversed, 100%) are both
    `(06.67-08.33)_CAM_B.mp4`; re-export the first alone, then everything with the tick on,
    and the reversed shot was never written — `[1/21] HAVE 05_…` twice, both rows pointing
    at the forward clip, frame_exact true on each. Two cameras that both name their files
    C0001.MP4 did the same, delivering card B as card A. A file the record does not vouch
    for is re-encoded: that costs seconds, and the other way ships the wrong picture.

    """The product owner's two rules (23 Sep) for a folder this run writes into, applied to
    what the folder's ledger knows — and applied IN THE ORDER A CANCEL CAN SURVIVE.

    1. A file this run cannot reuse is MOVED into ASIDE_DIR, never deleted, and the run says
       which and why on a `!!` line.
    2. A clip still correct but whose NUMBER changed is re-encoded under the new number and
       its old-numbered file DELETED — only when FolderLedger.vouches() proves this tool
       wrote that file for that same cut at these settings. Anything it cannot prove falls
       under rule 1.

    ⚠️ WHY THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE FIX. The build before moved EVERY held and stale file into
    ASIDE_DIR before the first encode and printed the `!!` lines after the pool, which a
    Cancel never reaches. MEASURED on it: a complete 12-clip folder, the head clip lifted so
    every later clip renumbers, --resume, the panel's Cancel 0.3 s into the encodes —
    rc -15, zero `!!` lines, the delivery EMPTY, all 12 files aside, and the ledger had
    forgotten every one. So now:

    * A file that is only RENUMBERED stays exactly where it is, in the ledger, until its
      clip's re-encode under the new number has LANDED; only then is it deleted (rule 2) or
      moved aside (rule 1, when the ledger cannot vouch). A clip that fails, is refused,
      goes offline, is cancelled or never runs leaves it untouched.
    * Only a file of a clip the edit no longer has is moved before the encodes — it can
      never be needed again — with its `!!` line printed and the ledger noting where it
      went in the same uninterrupted() step.
    * A clip whose new name is still occupied by ANOTHER clip's not-yet-replaced file keeps
      its finished encode under its hidden partial name (it stays registered, so a Cancel
      removes it) and is swapped in only when that other clip lands. Two clips of one
      source range trade names on an insert ahead of them; a chain of them resolves from
      the free end, and a cycle lands in one step.

    Every step that changes a delivery name runs inside uninterrupted(), so the stop
    handler waits for it: a Cancel at any moment leaves each still-valid clip either under
    a number the ledger knows or replaced by its re-encode, and the log and the ledger say
    what the folder holds.

    # pick_key() and render_name(): two cuts under a cross-dissolve start on the same frame of
    # the same track, and with the in-point alone both announced the SAME key. The panel put
    # the second one's "encoding" state, elapsed time and result on the first one's row, so one
    # row was told two stories and the other stayed dark for the whole run.
    #
    # Name stays LAST so an older panel's `>>\s+(.+)` still reads something sensible, and a
    # newer panel treats the key as optional for the same reason in reverse. The cost of the
    # fourth field is paid THERE and it is worth knowing exactly: a panel older than this
    # engine cannot match `[a-z]+/\d+/\d+` against `video/1/448/458`, so it takes the whole
    # tail as the filename — its rows stay dark (which is already what it does with a line
    # carrying no key at all) and its live tally over-counts what is still encoding. The bar,
    # the log and the report off the manifest are all unaffected, and both halves are
    # installed together. No single-line format can do better: the old pattern's name group
    # runs to the end of the line, so ANY field added anywhere is swallowed by it.

    # thirty-one holes in the sequence. Every hole is a Dynamic Link comp, a title or an
    # adjustment layer: media_kind "unsupported", which source mode can never decode. They
    # were taking a number each on the way past.
    #
    # ⚠️ media_kind ONLY — NOT source_exists. A file that is merely missing is a REPAIRABLE
    # failure: relink it and it delivers. If a missing source lost its number, relinking and
    # re-exporting would renumber everything after it and the repair would break the very
    # filenames it was meant to restore. So offline media keeps its place in the sequence and
    # only the structurally undeliverable are skipped.

    # undeliverable in Source Render and perfectly deliverable in Timeline Render, where the

    # His two numbers, exactly.

    #
    # Reported 17 Sep, after the fix above had shipped in 3.86: "his first read still wrong",
    # with a list numbered to 60 under a footer promising 29 files — the same symptom, on a
    # sequence that had been read once. The panel only learns which video tracks exist FROM a
    # read (the menu is built from the scan's own manifest), so on the FIRST read of a session
    # state.vtrackWant is empty and --video-track is not sent at all. The flag arrives from the
    # second read onwards, which is why it looked fixed.
    #
    # So the default belongs here, where the numbering is: in render mode with no track named,
    # take the LOWEST video track that has numberable cuts — the same rule the panel's menu
    # uses for its own default, so the read and the export cannot disagree about it.
    #
    # NUMBERING ONLY. args.video_track is deliberately NOT written back: the filter ~70 lines
    # below reads it too, it is gated on --render-dir, and a CLI export that never named a
    # track must keep writing what it writes today. This changes which cuts take a NUMBER,
    # never which cuts become files.
    #
    # And it fires only when the flag was OMITTED. `--video-track 0` is a real answer meaning
    # "every video track", which is why the argument's default is None rather than 0.
    # Two clauses that were here are gone because nothing could tell them apart from their
    # neighbours: an `_rmode and` on this `if` (the skip below already asks, and the
    # source-mode check in check_render_mode.py is what proves that one), and a
    # render_planned/media_kind filter on the track list (in render mode render_planned is
    # set for EVERY video cut a few lines above, so it selected nothing). A clause no test
    # can fail is a claim nobody can check.
    #
    # ⚠️ AND IT IS GATED ON THERE BEING NO --render-dir, BECAUSE THE FILTER IS WHAT MAKES A
    # DEFAULT SAFE. The filter ~70 lines below reads args.video_track itself, and for an
    # OMITTED flag that is 0 — "keep every video track". So on an export it keeps all of
    # them while this would have numbered only the lowest: every cut off that track is
    # written, carrying index 0, and two of them sharing a timeline range and a source name
    # resolve to the SAME filename. Measured on a three-track fixture: four cuts, three
    # files, one shot lost to an overwrite, and a --resume rerun then reporting
    # "1 written, 0 failed … 3 already there" over the folder that was missing it. 3.86
    # numbered the same four 01..04.
    #
    # A scan has no filter to disagree with — it reports every row either way — so the
    # default does its job there, which is the first read this exists for. An export that
    # named no track keeps doing exactly what it did in 3.86: every video track numbered,
    # every video track written. That is also what this block's own comment above promises

    # cannot replace the file it was meant to replace: clip 07 comes back as 01 and now there
    # are two of it. Numbering fresh is right for a first export of a subset and wrong for a
    # repair, and a repair is what the tick is for.
    #
    # ⚠️ --ext IS INCLUDED, and excluding it was wrong. The first cut of this reasoned that
    # --ext "selects by file TYPE rather than naming clips, so it has no 'these specific ones
    # again' meaning to preserve". That is true of the flag and false of the workflow: the
    # panel's file-type chips ARE --ext, so unticking .png and .aegraphic is how an editor
    # narrows an export, and it renumbered everything left.
    #
    # MEASURED on the real client export it was reported from: a full run numbers two of its
    # clips 33 and 58, and with only one file type ticked the same clips come out 15 and 27 —

        # taking it on trust.

        # probe() catches everything it can raise and returns {"_probe_failed": …}, so a
        # worker cannot bring the pool down, and a source that fails here fails identically
